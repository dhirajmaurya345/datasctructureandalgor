Steps to learn data sctructure and algorithm 

1. Learn a programming language
2. learn about Complexity
   a. Time Comlexity 
       There are five types of Time complexity Cases:
       Constant Time Complexity - O(1)
       Logarithmic Time Complexity - O(log n)
       Linear Time Complexity - O(n)
       O(n log n) Time Complexity
       Quadratic Time Complexity - O(n2)

   b. Space complexity     
    O(1) – constant complexity – takes the same amount of space regardless of the input size
    O(log n) – logarithmic complexity – takes space proportional to the log of the input size
    O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size
    O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its space complexity grows proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor
    O(n^2) – square/polynomial complexity – space complexity grows proportionally to the square of the input size

3. Data Structure and algorithm 
   1. Array
   2. String
   3. Linked List
