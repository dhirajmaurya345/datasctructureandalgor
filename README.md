Steps to learn data sctructure and algorithm 

1. Learn a programming language
2. learn about Complexity  
   a. Time Comlexity : 
     There are five types of Time complexity Cases:
       Constant Time Complexity - O(1)
       Logarithmic Time Complexity - O(log n)
       Linear Time Complexity - O(n)
       O(n log n) Time Complexity
       Quadratic Time Complexity - O(n2)

   b. Space complexity :   
    O(1) – constant complexity – takes the same amount of space regardless of the input size
    O(log n) – logarithmic complexity – takes space proportional to the log of the input size
    O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size
    O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its space complexity grows proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor
    O(n^2) – square/polynomial complexity – space complexity grows proportionally to the square of the input size

3. Data Structure and algorithm 
   1. Array or Object
   
   Big O of Object methode: 
   1. Object.key - O(n)
   2. Object.value - O(n)
   3. Object.enteries - O(n)
   4. hasOwnProperty - O(n)
   5. Insertion - O(1)
   7. Removal -O(1) 
   8. Searching - O(n)
   9. Access  - O(1)
   
   Big O of Array methode: 
   1. Searching -  O(n)
   2. Access - O(n)
   3. push - O(1)
   4. pop - O(1)
   5. Shift - O(n)
   6. unshift - O(n)
   7. concat - O(n)
   8. slice - O(n)
   9. splice - O(n)
   10. sort - O(nlogn)
   11. forEach/map/filter/reduce/ect - O(n)
   
   3. String
   4. Linked List
